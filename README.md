### Hi there üëãüèΩ I'm **Reysmer**

Thank you for checking out my Github profile! 

Here you'll find side projects, gists, learning paths, and contributions to the community. Feel free to review, fork, star, and issue any repository. Feedback is always appreciated!

I am a dedicated developer with experience in multiple Javascript projects using [React], [Angular], and [Node]. I am always seeking to expand my knowledge and have recently been learning iOS Development, SwiftUI, React Native, Dart, and Flutter. 

I am eager to collaborate on Javascript and iOS projects and I am confident in my skills with Javascript, Python, React, React Native, Node, Express.js, NestJS, Next.js, iOS, Swift, Dart, Flutter, Jenkins, Docker, AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Consul, and Puppet. 

Aside from my passion for programming, I enjoy playing musical instruments such as the Keyboard, Guitar, and Harp. I love traveling, discovering new places, and swimming.
